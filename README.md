A Code written in Node.js to create a oauth bot.

Put your informations in `config.js` and after put your token in Secrets. If you don't know how to have your token go on youtube.

The [index.js](https://replit.com/@FelosiDev/Oauth-Bot-Discord#index.js) is the main file. [index.html](https://replit.com/@FelosiDev/Oauth-Bot-Discord#index.html) prevents your repl from going to sleep. 

Create an account on [Restorecord](https://restorecord.com/) and add a bot and a server for the auth link.

</br>
Complete this to start the oauth bot and dont forget to put your token in the secret environnement


`module.exports = {
  token: process.env.token, 
  port: "3000",
  prefix: "YOUR-PRefix",
  client: "THE_BOT_NAME",
  client_id: "THE_BOT_ID",
  client_secret: "THE_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET",
  redirect_uri: "https://restorecord.com/api/callback",
  footer: "FOOTER",
  support: "SUPPORT_SERVER_LINK",
  owners: "OWNER_ID",
  authLink: "YOUR_RESTORECORD_AUTH_LINK",

}

**DO NOT GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO OTHERS!**
