A Code written in Node.js to create a Oauth bot.

1. Create a bot on [Dev Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. The [index.js](https://replit.com/@FelosiDev/New-Oauth#index.js) is the main file. [server.js](https://replit.com/@FelosiDev/New-Oauth#server.js) prevents your repl from going to sleep.
3. Put your bot token in `secrets`
5. Create an account on [Restorecord](https://restorecord.com/) and add a bot and a server for the auth link.
6. Put the restorecord redirect url on your bot redirects in Oauth2.
7. In the code put the server verification link where it need to be.
6. Use [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) to make your repl online 24/7.

**DO NOT GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO OTHERS!**

üî∞ **I'm not responsible for what you do with the bot or if your account/server is banned from Discord**
